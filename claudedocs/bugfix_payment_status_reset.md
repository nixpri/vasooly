# Bug Fix: Payment Status Reset on Bill Update

**Issue**: When editing a bill (updating name or amount), all payment statuses were being reset to PENDING, losing track of which participants had already paid.

**Root Cause**: In `BillCreateScreen.tsx` line 152, the participant mapping was hardcoding `status: PaymentStatus.PENDING` for all participants, even in edit mode.

**Fix**: Modified participant mapping to preserve existing payment statuses by matching participants by name.

## Code Changes

### Before (Buggy Code)
```typescript
const participantData: Participant[] = splitResult.splits.map(
  (split, index) => ({
    id: isEditMode && existingBill
      ? existingBill.participants[index]?.id || `participant-${timestamp}-${index}`
      : `participant-${timestamp}-${index}`,
    name: split.participantName,
    amountPaise: split.amountPaise,
    status: PaymentStatus.PENDING,  // ❌ Always PENDING, loses payment data!
    phone: undefined,
  })
);
```

### After (Fixed Code)
```typescript
const participantData: Participant[] = splitResult.splits.map(
  (split, index) => {
    // Find existing participant by name to preserve payment status
    const existingParticipant = isEditMode && existingBill
      ? existingBill.participants.find((p) => p.name === split.participantName)
      : undefined;

    return {
      id: existingParticipant?.id || `participant-${timestamp}-${index}`,
      name: split.participantName,
      amountPaise: split.amountPaise,
      status: existingParticipant?.status || PaymentStatus.PENDING,  // ✅ Preserves status!
      phone: existingParticipant?.phone,  // ✅ Also preserves phone number
    };
  }
);
```

## How It Works

1. **Match by Name**: When in edit mode, finds the existing participant by matching their name
2. **Preserve Status**: If participant exists, preserves their payment status (PAID or PENDING)
3. **Preserve Phone**: Also preserves phone number if they have one
4. **Preserve ID**: Uses existing participant ID to maintain data consistency
5. **Default for New**: New participants default to PENDING status

## Edge Cases Handled

### ✅ Edit Bill Title Only
- **Before**: All payments reset to PENDING
- **After**: All payment statuses preserved ✓

### ✅ Edit Bill Amount Only
- **Before**: All payments reset to PENDING
- **After**: All payment statuses preserved ✓
- **Note**: Split amounts recalculate, but payment status preserved

### ✅ Edit Participant Name
- **Before**: Payment status lost
- **After**:
  - Unchanged names → status preserved ✓
  - Changed names → treated as new participant (PENDING)

### ✅ Add New Participant
- **Before**: Worked correctly
- **After**: Still works, new participant gets PENDING ✓

### ✅ Remove Participant
- **Before**: Other participants' statuses reset
- **After**: Remaining participants' statuses preserved ✓

### ⚠️ Reorder Participants
- **Before**: Statuses matched by index (wrong participant could get status)
- **After**: Statuses matched by name (correct!) ✓

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Edit Operations
- [ ] Create bill with 3 participants
- [ ] Mark 2 participants as PAID
- [ ] Edit bill title only
- [ ] **Expected**: 2 participants still show PAID

### Amount Changes
- [ ] Create bill: $30 split among 3 people (each owes $10)
- [ ] Mark 2 participants as PAID
- [ ] Change amount to $60
- [ ] **Expected**: 2 participants still show PAID (now owe $20 each)

### Participant Name Changes
- [ ] Create bill with participants: Alice, Bob, Charlie
- [ ] Mark Bob as PAID
- [ ] Rename Charlie to David
- [ ] **Expected**:
  - Alice: PENDING ✓
  - Bob: PAID ✓
  - David: PENDING (new participant) ✓

### Add/Remove Participants
- [ ] Create bill with 2 participants
- [ ] Mark 1 as PAID
- [ ] Add a 3rd participant
- [ ] **Expected**: Original 2 keep their status, new one is PENDING

### Complex Scenario
- [ ] Create bill: $100, 4 participants (each $25)
- [ ] Mark 3 participants as PAID (progress 75%)
- [ ] Edit amount to $200 (each now $50)
- [ ] **Expected**: 3 participants still PAID, progress still 75%

## Technical Details

### Why Match by Name?
- **Index matching is fragile**: If participant order changes, wrong person gets wrong status
- **Name matching is semantic**: "Alice" in the edited list is the same "Alice" from before
- **User intent**: When user edits a bill, they expect "the person who paid" to still show as paid

### Limitations
- If user completely renames a participant (Alice → Bob), it's treated as removing Alice and adding Bob
- This is actually correct behavior - it's a different person

### Performance
- `find()` operation is O(n) but participant lists are small (typically 2-10 people)
- No performance concerns
