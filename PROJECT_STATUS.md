```

### Test Results
```
Test Suites: 2 passed, 2 total
Tests:       10 passed, 10 total
Coverage:    100% (split engine)
```

### Quality Checks
- ✅ TypeScript: No errors (`npm run typecheck`)
- ✅ ESLint: No warnings (`npm run lint`)
- ✅ Tests: 10/10 passing (`npm test`)
- ✅ Coverage: 100% on business logic

## ✅ Day 3-4: Database Encryption Setup - COMPLETE

### Security Implementation ✅
- ✅ Configured SQLCipher encryption with expo-sqlite
- ✅ 256-bit encryption key management with expo-secure-store
- ✅ OS-level key storage (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore)
- ✅ Created database schema (bills + participants)
- ✅ Implemented data access layer with transaction support
- ✅ Set up migration system with rollback capability
- ✅ 23 passing tests for encryption and repository
- ✅ TypeScript compilation verified

### Files Created
**Data Layer** (`src/lib/data/`):
- `encryption.ts` - Key management with secure storage
- `database.ts` - SQLite initialization with encryption
- `billRepository.ts` - CRUD operations with type safety
- `migrations.ts` - Schema versioning system
- `index.ts` - Public API exports

**Tests**:
- `encryption.test.ts` - Key management tests (9 tests)
- `billRepository.test.ts` - Repository tests (14 tests)

**Documentation**:
- `docs/DATABASE_SETUP.md` - Complete encryption guide

### Test Results
```
Test Suites: 4 passed, 4 total (2 business + 2 data)
Tests:       33 passed, 33 total (10 business + 23 data)
Coverage:    100% on critical paths
```

### Security Features
- 🔒 256-bit AES encryption key
- 🔑 OS Keychain integration (device unlock required)
- 💾 Encrypted SQLite with SQLCipher
- 🔄 Soft delete support (data recovery)
- 📊 Foreign key constraints (data integrity)
- 🔄 Transaction-safe operations

## ✅ Day 5: Soft Delete Enhancement - COMPLETE

### Advanced Soft Delete Features ✅
- ✅ Restore functionality for soft-deleted bills
- ✅ Query deleted bills for recovery UI (`getDeletedBills`)
- ✅ Auto-cleanup for old deleted records (configurable retention)
- ✅ Batch operations for bulk delete/restore
- ✅ 8 additional tests (41 total passing)
- ✅ Comprehensive soft delete guide documentation

### Features Implemented
**Core Recovery**:
- `restoreBill()` - Undelete bills back to ACTIVE status
- `getDeletedBills()` - Query all soft-deleted bills for trash UI
- `cleanupOldDeletedBills(days)` - Auto-cleanup with configurable retention (default: 30 days)

**Batch Operations**:
- `restoreBillsBatch(ids)` - Bulk restore with transaction safety
- `deleteBillsBatch(ids)` - Bulk soft delete with transaction safety
- Returns count of successfully processed bills

**Documentation**:
- `docs/SOFT_DELETE_GUIDE.md` - Complete implementation guide
- API reference with usage patterns
- UI implementation examples (trash screen, undo, bulk selection)
- Best practices and troubleshooting

### Test Results
```
Test Suites: 4 passed, 4 total
Tests:       41 passed, 41 total (19 data layer, 9 encryption, 10 business, 3 other)
Coverage:    100% on critical paths
```

### Usage Example
```typescript
// Trash screen with restore
const deletedBills = await getDeletedBills();

// Undo delete
await restoreBill(billId);

// Bulk restore
await restoreBillsBatch(['bill-1', 'bill-2', 'bill-3']);

// Auto-cleanup (30+ days old)
await cleanupOldDeletedBills(30);
```
