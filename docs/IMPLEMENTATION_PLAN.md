## Quality Gates

Each phase has mandatory quality gates:

### Phase 0 Gate
- [x] Database encryption working
- [x] UPI validation complete (8/10 devices)
- [x] 60fps POC successful
- [x] **Decision**: ✅ Proceed to Phase 1

### Phase 1 Gate
- [x] 90%+ test coverage for business logic
- [x] All CRUD operations working
- [x] Can create bill and generate UPI links
- [x] **Decision**: ✅ Proceed to Phase 2

### Phase 2 Gate

- [x] 60fps animations on mid-range devices
- [x] Native modules working
- [x] **Decision**: ✅ Proceed to Phase 2A

### Phase 2A Gate
- [ ] All 12 screens implemented
- [ ] Design system 100% consistent
- [ ] All user flows tested
- [ ] **Decision**: Proceed to Phase 3 or extend refinement

### Phase 3 Gate
- [ ] All E2E tests passing
- [ ] <5 P1 bugs remaining
- [ ] Manual testing complete
- [ ] **Decision**: Proceed to beta or fix major issues

### Phase 4 Gate
- [ ] Beta users satisfied (>4/5)
- [ ] Zero P0 bugs
- [ ] Crash-free > 99.5%
- [ ] **Decision**: Proceed to launch or extend beta

### Phase 5 Gate

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: UPI links don't work on some devices
**Mitigation**: Test on 10+ devices in Phase 0, implement fallbacks, provide clear error messages

**Risk**: 60fps animations not achievable
**Mitigation**: Build POC in Week 2, use Skia (not CSS), profile early, cut animations if needed

**Risk**: Database encryption breaks performance
**Mitigation**: Benchmark in Week 1, optimize queries, use indexes, test on low-end devices

**Risk**: Timeline slips
**Mitigation**: Weekly retrospectives, cut scope not quality, focus on MVP features only

### Launch Risks

**Risk**: App store rejection
**Mitigation**: Follow guidelines, legal review, test privacy features, provide clear descriptions

**Risk**: Crash spike after launch
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, beta period, crash monitoring, hotfix plan ready

**Risk**: Poor user reviews
**Mitigation**: Beta testing, polish animations, user-friendly errors, fast support response

## Session Summary

### Key Learnings

1. **Timeline Reality**: Financial apps need 8-10x more time due to security, testing, compliance
2. **Architecture Review Value**: Expert review found 9 critical issues, prevented 12+ weeks of rework
3. **Performance vs Polish**: CRED-like UX requires Skia (3-4 week investment), not CSS
4. **UPI Complexity**: Deep links not standardized, need 2 weeks validation + fallbacks
5. **Security Non-Negotiable**: Encryption, testing, data protection cannot be shortcuts

### Technical Decisions Made

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Framework | React Native | Performance + ecosystem + animations |
| State | Zustand | Lightweight, no Redux boilerplate |
| Database | SQLite + SQLCipher | Encrypted, ACID, mature |
| Animations | Reanimated 3 | 60fps worklets on UI thread |
| Rounding | Paise-exact only | Simplicity, transparency |
| UPI Reference | Fresh per send | Better tracking, no caching |
| Theme | Dark-only MVP | Focus core UX first |
| Colors | Earthen (Terracotta + Sage) | Differentiation from generic purple |
| Icons | Lucide React Native | Professional, accessible, tree-shakable |

### Scope Decisions

**In MVP**:
- Equal split only
- Manual payment confirmation
- Local storage with manual export
- Dark theme only
- Contact picker OR manual entry
- UPI links + QR codes
- Timeline activity feed
- Basic spending insights

**Deferred to V1.1+**:
- Ratio/fixed splits
- Automatic payment detection
- Cloud sync
- OCR bill scanning
- Light theme
- Link analytics
- Advanced debt optimization
- Multi-currency support
