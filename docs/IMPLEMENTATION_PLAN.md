  - Uses historyStore.loadBills(), refreshBills(), setSearchQuery()
  - Removed direct billRepository calls
  - React Navigation integration for screen transitions
- [x] **BillDetailScreen** (Updated - ~295 lines)
  - Integrated billStore for bill data (getBillById)
  - Integrated settingsStore for default VPA
  - Uses markParticipantPaid/Pending from billStore
  - React Navigation params (billId from route)
  - Delete functionality with store integration

#### Navigation Structure ‚úÖ
```
Stack.Navigator (initialRouteName: "BillHistory")
‚îú‚îÄ BillHistory (fade animation)
‚îú‚îÄ BillCreate (modal, slide_from_bottom)
‚îú‚îÄ BillDetail (slide_from_right)
‚îî‚îÄ Settings (modal, slide_from_bottom)
```

#### Navigation Type Safety ‚úÖ
```typescript
type RootStackParamList = {
  BillHistory: undefined;
  BillCreate: { bill?: Bill } | undefined;
  BillDetail: { billId: string };
  Settings: undefined;
};
```

#### Files Created/Modified (6 files)
**Created (1 new file)**:
1. `src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx` (~460 lines)

**Modified (5 files)**:
2. `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` - Full React Navigation migration
3. `src/screens/BillHistoryScreen.tsx` - historyStore integration
4. `src/screens/BillDetailScreen.tsx` - billStore + settingsStore integration
5. `src/stores/historyStore.ts` - Added loadBills/refreshBills aliases
6. `src/screens/index.ts` - Added SettingsScreen export

#### Code Metrics ‚úÖ
- **Lines Added**: ~600 lines (SettingsScreen + navigation setup)
- **Lines Modified**: ~300 lines (store integrations)
- **Total Tests**: 314 passing (all existing tests still pass)
- **TypeScript**: ‚úÖ 0 errors
- **ESLint**: ‚úÖ 0 errors (14 acceptable warnings in existing tests)

#### Technical Highlights ‚úÖ
- **Store Integration**: All screens use Zustand stores (no direct repository calls)
- **Optimistic Updates**: billStore handles updates with automatic UI refresh
- **Persistence**: settingsStore saves VPA to SecureStore across sessions
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with navigation types
- **Native Transitions**: Stack navigator with native animations (slide, modal, fade)
- **Gesture Support**: Full swipe-back and gesture navigation enabled

### Week 9 Success Criteria ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
‚úÖ React Navigation installed and configured (native-stack)
‚úÖ Settings Screen created with settingsStore integration
‚úÖ BillHistoryScreen integrated with historyStore
‚úÖ BillDetailScreen integrated with billStore + settingsStore
‚úÖ All screens use React Navigation (no legacy callbacks)
‚úÖ Native screen transitions working (slide, modal, fade)
‚úÖ TypeScript validation passing (0 errors)
‚úÖ ESLint validation passing (0 errors)
‚úÖ All 314 tests passing
‚úÖ Deep linking structure implemented (ready for future activation)

#### Critical Fix: react-native-screens Version Compatibility ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Android app crashed on launch with "java.lang.String cannot be cast to java.lang.Boolean" error

**Root Cause**: Version incompatibility between `react-native-screens@4.17.1` (auto-installed) and Expo SDK 54's expected version `~4.16.0`. The newer version changed how props are passed to native Android code, causing type casting errors.

**Diagnosis Process**:
1. Created minimal test App.tsx without React Navigation - ‚úÖ worked
2. Added minimal React Navigation - ‚ùå crashed
3. Ran `npx expo install --check` to validate package versions
4. Identified version mismatch: 4.17.1 installed vs ~4.16.0 required

**Fix Applied**:
```bash
npx expo install react-native-screens@~4.16.0
```

**Additional Required Changes**:
- Added `GestureHandlerRootView` wrapper in App.tsx (required for React Navigation on Android)
- Added proper import order: `'react-native-gesture-handler'` before other RN imports
- Removed invalid `fullScreenGestureEnabled` prop from screenOptions (not supported by native-stack)

**Key Learning**: Always use `npx expo install [package]` instead of `npm install` for React Native packages to ensure Expo SDK compatibility. Use `npx expo install --check` to validate all package versions match SDK requirements.

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: UPI links don't work on some devices
**Mitigation**: Test on 10+ devices in Phase 0, implement fallbacks, provide clear error messages

**Risk**: 60fps animations not achievable
**Mitigation**: Build POC in Week 2, use Skia (not CSS), profile early, cut animations if needed

**Risk**: Database encryption breaks performance
**Mitigation**: Benchmark in Week 1, optimize queries, use indexes, test on low-end devices

**Risk**: Timeline slips
**Mitigation**: Weekly retrospectives, cut scope not quality, focus on MVP features only

### Launch Risks

**Risk**: App store rejection
**Mitigation**: Follow guidelines, legal review, test privacy features, provide clear descriptions

**Risk**: Crash spike after launch
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, beta period, crash monitoring, hotfix plan ready

**Risk**: Poor user reviews
**Mitigation**: Beta testing, polish animations, user-friendly errors, fast support response

---

## Session Summary

### Key Learnings

1. **Timeline Reality**: Financial apps need 8-10x more time due to security, testing, compliance
2. **Architecture Review Value**: Expert review found 9 critical issues, prevented 12+ weeks of rework
3. **Performance vs Polish**: CRED-like UX requires Skia (3-4 week investment), not CSS
4. **UPI Complexity**: Deep links not standardized, need 2 weeks validation + fallbacks
5. **Security Non-Negotiable**: Encryption, testing, data protection cannot be shortcuts

### Technical Decisions Made

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Framework | React Native | Performance + ecosystem + animations |
| State | Zustand | Lightweight, no Redux boilerplate |
| Database | SQLite + SQLCipher | Encrypted, ACID, mature |
| Animations | Reanimated 3 | 60fps worklets on UI thread |
| Rounding | Paise-exact only | Simplicity, transparency |
| UPI Reference | Fresh per send | Better tracking, no caching |
| Theme | Dark-only MVP | Focus core UX first |

### Scope Decisions

**In MVP**:
- Equal split only
- Manual payment confirmation
- Local storage with manual export
- Dark theme only
- Contact picker OR manual entry
- UPI links + QR codes

**Deferred to V1.1+**:
- Ratio/fixed splits
- Automatic payment detection
- Cloud sync
- OCR bill scanning
- Light theme
- Link analytics
