## Test Implementation (Completed)

### Week7TestScreen (Removed After Testing)

The test screen was created at `src/screens/Week7TestScreen.tsx` and has been removed after successful testing.

```typescript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TouchableOpacity, ScrollView, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import {
  pickContact,
  shareViaWhatsApp,
  shareContent,
  pickImage,
  pickPDF,
  formatFileSize,
} from '../services';

export function Week7TestScreen() {
  const [result, setResult] = useState<string>('');

  const testContactPicker = async () => {
    const res = await pickContact();
    setResult(JSON.stringify(res, null, 2));
  };

  const testShare = async () => {
    const message = 'Hi! 👋\n\nYou owe ₹50.00 for "Test".\n\nThanks! 🙏';
    const res = await shareContent({ message, title: 'Payment Request' });
    setResult(JSON.stringify(res, null, 2));
  };

  const testWhatsApp = async () => {
    const message = 'Testing WhatsApp share from Vasooly!';
    const res = await shareViaWhatsApp(message);
    setResult(JSON.stringify(res, null, 2));
  };

  const testImagePicker = async () => {
    const res = await pickImage();
    setResult(JSON.stringify(res, null, 2));
  };

  const testPDFPicker = async () => {
    const res = await pickPDF();
    setResult(JSON.stringify(res, null, 2));
  };

  return (
    <ScrollView style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.title}>Week 7 Native Services Test</Text>

      <TouchableOpacity style={styles.button} onPress={testContactPicker}>
        <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Test Contact Picker</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>

      <TouchableOpacity style={styles.button} onPress={testShare}>
        <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Test Generic Share</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>

      <TouchableOpacity style={styles.button} onPress={testWhatsApp}>
        <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Test WhatsApp Share</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>

      <TouchableOpacity style={styles.button} onPress={testImagePicker}>
        <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Test Image Picker</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>

      <TouchableOpacity style={styles.button} onPress={testPDFPicker}>
        <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Test PDF Picker</Text>

      <View style={styles.resultContainer}>
        <Text style={styles.resultTitle}>Result:</Text>
        <Text style={styles.resultText}>{result}</Text>
      </View>
    </ScrollView>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 20,
    backgroundColor: '#0A0A0F',
  },
  title: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    color: '#FFFFFF',
    marginBottom: 20,
    marginTop: 40,
  },
  button: {
    backgroundColor: '#6C5CE7',
    padding: 16,
    borderRadius: 12,
    marginBottom: 12,
  },
  buttonText: {
    color: '#FFFFFF',
    fontSize: 16,
    fontWeight: '600',
    textAlign: 'center',
  },
  resultContainer: {
    marginTop: 20,
    padding: 16,
    backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05)',
    borderRadius: 12,
  },
  resultTitle: {
    color: '#6C5CE7',
    fontSize: 16,
    fontWeight: '600',
    marginBottom: 8,
  },
  resultText: {
    color: '#FFFFFF',
    fontSize: 12,
    fontFamily: 'monospace',
  },
});
```

### Update App.tsx

```typescript
import { Week7TestScreen } from './src/screens/Week7TestScreen';

export default function App() {
  return <Week7TestScreen />;
}
```
