## 🚨 Critical Issues (Must Know)

### Tier 1 Blockers (Fix Before Launch)

**Issue #1: Database Encryption** (Risk: 9/10)
**Problem**: Financial data in plaintext SQLite
**Fix**: SQLCipher + OS Keychain integration
**Effort**: 1 week
**Impact**: App store rejection, data breach risk

**Issue #2: UPI Validation** (Risk: 8/10)
**Problem**: No validation that links work across all UPI apps
**Fix**: Validation framework + 10+ device testing
**Effort**: 2 weeks
**Impact**: App may not work for many users

**Issue #3: Performance Guarantees** (Risk: 7/10)
**Problem**: CSS blur can't hit 60fps on mid-range devices
**Fix**: Skia-based glass effects
**Effort**: 1-2 weeks
**Impact**: CRED-like promise fails

**Issue #4: Data Loss Prevention** (Risk: 9/10)
**Problem**: No backups, hard deletes, no undo
**Fix**: Soft deletes + automatic backup system
**Effort**: 1 week
**Impact**: Users permanently lose bill data

**→ See [docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md](docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md) for all 9 issues and fixes**

## 📐 Core Concepts

### 1. UPI Payment Links
**What**: Deep links (`upi://pay?pa=...`) that open recipient's existing UPI app
**Why**: Zero-install experience for recipients
**Challenge**: Different UPI apps handle links differently (GPay, PhonePe, Paytm)

### 2. Local-First Architecture
**What**: All bill data stored locally in encrypted SQLite
**Why**: Privacy, offline functionality, no server costs
**Trade-off**: No multi-device sync in MVP (V2 feature)

### 3. Split Engine
**What**: Core algorithm dividing bills with paise-exact rounding
**Math**: Uses integer paise (not floats) to avoid precision errors
**Example**: ₹100 ÷ 3 = [3334, 3333, 3333] paise

### 4. CRED-like UX
**What**: Premium dark UI with glass effects, spring animations, celebrations
**How**: Reanimated 3 worklets (60fps), Skia for glass blur
**Challenge**: Performance-intensive, requires optimization

## 🎯 MVP Scope

### ✅ In Scope (Production MVP)
- Equal split only (no ratio/fixed)
- Manual payment confirmation
- Local storage with manual JSON export
- Dark theme only
- Contact picker OR manual entry
- Image/PDF attachments (no OCR)
- UPI links + QR codes
- Share via WhatsApp/SMS
- Bill history and duplication

### ❌ Out of Scope (V1.1+)
- Ratio or fixed-amount splits
- Automatic payment detection via SMS
- Cloud sync across devices
- OCR bill scanning
- Light theme
- Link shortener with analytics
- In-app notifications
- CSV import/export

**Strategy**: Remove features, not quality or security

## 📅 Timeline Reality Check

### Original PRD: 2 weeks MVP ❌
**Reality**: Only achievable for non-production demo

### Production-Ready: 18 weeks ✅

| Phase | Duration | What Gets Built |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **Phase 0: Foundation** | 2 weeks | Security, encryption, performance POCs |
| **Phase 1: Core Dev** | 4 weeks | Split engine, UPI, database, basic UI |
| **Phase 2: Integration** | 4 weeks | Native modules, animations, polish |
| **Phase 3: Testing** | 3 weeks | Unit, integration, E2E, manual tests |
| **Phase 4: Beta** | 2 weeks | User testing, bug fixes |
| **Phase 5: Launch** | 3 weeks | Final polish, app store submission |

**Why the Gap?**
2-week estimate ignored: encryption (1w), UPI validation (2w), performance (2w), testing (3w), security (1w), beta (2w), stores (1w) = **12 weeks missing**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start (5 Minutes)

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone <repository-url>
cd vasooly
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Run on Android device/emulator (Expo Go)
npm run android

# Or scan QR code with Expo Go app
```

**Current Build**: UPI Validation Screen opens automatically for device testing

### Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm start                  # Start Metro bundler
npm run android            # Run on Android
npm run ios                # Run on iOS

# Testing
npm test                   # Run unit tests (104 passing)
npm run test:coverage      # Generate coverage report
npm run validate           # Full quality check (typecheck + lint + tests)

# Quality
npm run lint               # ESLint check
npm run lint:fix           # Auto-fix lint issues
npm run typecheck          # TypeScript validation
```

### Testing UPI Validation

The app currently opens to the UPI Validation Screen for device testing:

1. **Run Validation**: Tap "Run UPI Validation" to detect installed UPI apps
2. **Test Standard URI**: Opens system app selector with all UPI apps
3. **Test Smart URI**: Uses intelligent fallback for your device
4. **Generate QR Code**: Creates scannable 250x250 QR code for ₹100 test payment

**Test Results**: OnePlus 13 (Android 15) - All tests passing ✅

## 🆘 Common Issues & Solutions

**"UPI links don't open in some apps"**
→ Implement app-specific fallback URIs (see SYSTEM_DESIGN.md Section 5.2)
→ Test on GPay, PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM minimum

**"Animations are janky"**
→ Use Reanimated worklets on UI thread (not Animated API)
→ Replace CSS blur with Skia glass effects
→ Profile with Flipper Performance Monitor

**"App crashes on older devices"**
→ Use FlashList for all lists (not FlatList)
→ Compress images, memoize expensive components
→ Profile with Xcode Instruments / Android Profiler

**"Data lost after reinstall"**
→ Implement automatic backup (SYSTEM_DESIGN.md Section 7.4)
→ Educate users on manual JSON export

**"Timeline is slipping"**
→ Cut scope, not quality (remove ratio splits, OCR, light theme)
→ Weekly retrospectives with IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md checklist
