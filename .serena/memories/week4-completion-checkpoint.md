- **Features**:
  - Complete bill overview with payment summary
  - Payment progress visualization (paid vs pending)
  - Per-participant payment status display
  - Toggle payment status (tap to mark paid/pending)
  - UPI payment integration (Pay Now, Share Link)
  - Action buttons (Duplicate, Edit, Delete)
  - Fully settled banner
  - Glass-morphism cards and animations

### 3. App Navigation System
- **File**: `App.tsx` (enhanced with multi-screen navigation)
- **Features**:
  - Multi-screen navigation with React hooks state management
  - Bill creation → History → Detail → Edit flow
  - Edit mode support in BillCreateScreen
  - Callback-based navigation pattern
  - Screen state preservation

### 4. UI/UX Enhancements
- **Consistent Styling**: Harmonized all three screens (BillCreate, BillHistory, BillDetail)
  - Unified header styling (paddingTop: 52, paddingBottom: 16)
  - Consistent content padding (20px horizontal and vertical)
  - Matching footer padding (16px bottom on Android)
  - Glass-morphism design applied uniformly
  
- **Android Keyboard Handling**:
  - KeyboardAvoidingView with height behavior
  - Negative vertical offset (-150px) for better positioning
  - Dynamic scroll padding (300px when keyboard visible)
  - Pan mode keyboard layout (`softwareKeyboardLayoutMode: "pan"` in app.json)
  - Fixed white space issue when keyboard hidden
  - Smooth scrolling to focused inputs

### 5. Database Integration
- **History**: Integrated with `getAllBills()`, `searchBills()`
- **Detail**: Integrated with `updateParticipantStatus()`
- **Edit Flow**: BillCreateScreen supports edit mode with existing bill data
- **Delete**: Soft delete integration with billRepository
- **Duplicate**: Creates new bill from existing template
- **UPI**: Payment link generation and sharing per participant

- Share functionality with formatted message
- App selector integration via Linking API
- Error handling for missing UPI apps

### Keyboard Handling (Android-optimized)
- KeyboardAvoidingView with proper configuration
- Dynamic padding based on keyboard visibility
- Pan mode for automatic screen adjustment
- No white space when keyboard hidden

## User Flows Implemented

### Flow 1: Create → View History
1. Create bill on BillCreateScreen
2. Success callback navigates to BillHistoryScreen
3. See new bill at top of list
4. Pull to refresh for updates

### Flow 2: View Bill Details
1. Tap bill card in history
2. Navigate to BillDetailScreen
3. See payment progress and participant details
4. Toggle payment status or send UPI links

### Flow 3: Edit Bill
1. From BillDetailScreen, tap "Edit"
2. Navigate to BillCreateScreen in edit mode
3. Modify title, amount, or participants
4. Save updates, return to detail view

### Flow 4: Pay via UPI
1. From BillDetailScreen, see pending participant
2. Tap "Pay Now" → Opens UPI app with pre-filled amount
3. Complete payment in UPI app
4. Return to app, manually mark as paid
5. Progress bar updates automatically

## Quality Checks
✅ TypeScript: No errors
✅ ESLint: No errors
✅ Consistent design system across all screens
✅ Glass-morphism styling applied uniformly
✅ Keyboard handling tested on Android

## Metrics Update
- **Timeline**: 20/126 days complete (15.9%)
- **Files Created**: 58 total
- **Lines of Code**: ~9,635+
- **Screens**: 5 complete screens (Create, History, Detail, UPI Validation, Performance POC)
- **Complete Workflow**: Create → History → Detail → Edit flow working end-to-end

## Next Steps
- Week 5: Payment tracking and reminders
- Week 6: Contact integration and sharing

## Technical Debt
None identified - all implementations follow best practices and design patterns.

## Critical Learnings

### Android Keyboard Handling Best Practice
For React Native + Expo Android apps with keyboard input:
1. Use KeyboardAvoidingView with `behavior="height"` on Android
2. Set `keyboardVerticalOffset` negative value (-150 to -200) to push content higher
3. Add dynamic scroll padding (300px when keyboard visible)
4. Configure `softwareKeyboardLayoutMode: "pan"` in app.json
5. This combination eliminates both keyboard covering inputs AND white space issues

### Navigation Pattern
Callback-based navigation works well for small apps:
- Pass navigation callbacks as props (onBack, onCreate, onEdit, etc.)
- Manage screen state at App.tsx level with React hooks
- Preserve screen state during navigation
- Simple and effective for 3-5 screen apps

### FlashList Integration
FlashList from Shopify is essential for list performance:
- Use for any list with potential 100+ items
- Implement useCallback for renderItem to prevent re-renders
- Include estimatedItemSize when possible
- Significantly better performance than FlatList

## Session Context
- **Duration**: Multi-session work on Week 4 features
- **Platform**: Android testing (OnePlus 13, Android 15)
- **Focus**: UI/UX refinement and keyboard handling optimization
- **Status**: Week 4 COMPLETE ✅
