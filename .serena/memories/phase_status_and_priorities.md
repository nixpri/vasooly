## Next Priorities

### Immediate: Week 7 - Payment Status UI

**Rationale**: Week 6 (Basic UI) is already complete from Week 3-4. BillCreateScreen, BillAmountInput, ParticipantList, and SplitResultDisplay are all built and working.

**Week 7 Focus**: Integrate Status Manager into existing UI

**Tasks**:
1. **Refactor BillDetailScreen** to use Status Manager functions
   - Replace manual `calculateProgress()` with `computeSettlementSummary()`
   - Replace manual `getPaymentSummary()` with `computeSettlementSummary()`
   - Replace manual status updates with `updatePaymentStatus()`

2. **Add Settlement Progress Indicators**
   - Visual progress bar using `paidPercentage` from settlement summary
   - Display paid/pending counts and amounts
   - Show settlement status (ACTIVE/SETTLED)

3. **Remainder Calculation Display**
   - Show remaining amount for partial payments
   - List pending participants with amounts
   - Visual indicators for participants who paid vs pending

4. **Bulk Payment Status Updates**
   - "Mark All Paid" button using `updateBillPaymentStatuses()`
   - "Mark All Pending" button for reversal
   - Batch status updates with confirmation

5. **Bill Status Visual Indicators**
   - Badge/tag for ACTIVE bills (payments pending)
   - Badge/tag for SETTLED bills (fully paid)
   - Color-coded status indicators

### Medium Priority: Week 8 - UPI Integration UI

**Tasks**:
1. **UPI Link Generation UI**
   - "Generate UPI Link" button in BillDetailScreen
   - Per-participant UPI link generation
   - App selection dialog (17+ UPI apps)

2. **UPI Link Actions**
   - Copy link to clipboard with success toast
   - Share via WhatsApp/SMS/Email
   - Open directly in selected UPI app

3. **QR Code Generation**
   - Generate QR code for UPI payment
   - Display QR code in modal/screen
   - Save QR code to gallery
   - Share QR code image

4. **UPI Payment Tracking**
   - Link payment status updates to UPI actions
   - Auto-mark as paid after UPI link generation (optional)
   - Payment reminder functionality

### Lower Priority: Weeks 9-18

**Week 9-10**: Advanced Features (Custom splits, percentage splits, unequal splits)
**Week 11-12**: Contact Integration (Pick from contacts, auto-fill phone numbers)
**Week 13-14**: Notifications & Reminders (Push notifications, payment reminders)
**Week 15-16**: Analytics & Insights (Spending patterns, friend analytics)
**Week 17-18**: Polish & Testing (Performance, accessibility, E2E tests)

## Technical Debt & Improvements

### Existing Components Ready for Enhancement

**BillDetailScreen** (`src/screens/BillDetailScreen.tsx`):
- ✅ Payment status tracking (manual calculations)
- ✅ Participant list with payment toggles
- ✅ Edit/delete functionality
- 🔄 Can integrate Status Manager functions
- 🔄 Can add settlement progress indicators
- 🔄 Can display remainder calculations

**BillCreateScreen** (`src/screens/BillCreateScreen.tsx`):
- ✅ Complete bill creation workflow
- ✅ Real-time split calculation
- ✅ Database integration
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Edit mode support

**BillHistoryScreen** (`src/screens/BillHistoryScreen.tsx`):
- ✅ FlashList virtualized list
- ✅ Sort by date (newest first)
- ✅ Search and filter
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh
- ✅ Empty state handling
- 🔄 Can add settlement status indicators using Status Manager

### Integration Opportunities

**Status Manager → BillDetailScreen**:
```typescript
// Current (manual):
const calculateProgress = () => {
  const paidCount = bill.participants.filter(p => p.status === 'PAID').length;
  return (paidCount / bill.participants.length) * 100;
};

// Future (Status Manager):
const summary = computeSettlementSummary(bill);
const progress = summary.paidPercentage;
```

**Status Manager → BillHistoryScreen**:
```typescript
// Add settlement badges:
const summary = computeSettlementSummary(bill);
if (summary.isFullySettled) {
  return <Badge>SETTLED</Badge>;
} else if (summary.isPartiallySettled) {
  return <Badge>PARTIAL</Badge>;
} else {
  return <Badge>PENDING</Badge>;
}
```

## Dependencies & Blockers

### No Current Blockers ✅

**All Dependencies Available**:
- ✅ Status Manager (8 functions, 100% coverage)
- ✅ UPI Generator (7 functions, 100% coverage)
- ✅ Split Engine (98.52% coverage)
- ✅ Bill Repository (CRUD operations, 100% coverage)
- ✅ Database Layer (SQLite + SQLCipher, working)
- ✅ UI Components (4 components, glass-morphism design)
- ✅ Type System (Bill, Participant, enums)

### External Dependencies Status

**No Outstanding Issues**: All 17/17 expo-doctor checks passing

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Status Manager integration (pure functions, no side effects)
- UPI link generation (already tested, 100% coverage)
- Settlement indicators (read-only display from Status Manager)

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- QR code generation (requires react-native-qrcode-svg testing)
- Contact integration (permissions, privacy concerns)
- Push notifications (infrastructure setup needed)

### High Risk 🚨
- None currently identified

## Success Criteria for Week 7

**Must Have**:
- ✅ BillDetailScreen refactored to use Status Manager functions
- ✅ Settlement progress indicators visible and accurate
- ✅ Remainder calculations displayed for partial payments
- ✅ Bill status badges (ACTIVE/SETTLED) showing correctly
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved (no regressions)

**Should Have**:
- ✅ Bulk payment status update buttons working
- ✅ Visual polish on settlement indicators
- ✅ Animation/transitions for status changes
- ✅ Tests updated to reflect Status Manager integration

**Nice to Have**:
- ✅ Payment reminder functionality
- ✅ Settlement celebration animation for fully paid bills
- ✅ Historical payment tracking (who paid when)

## Timeline Estimate

**Week 7 Completion**: 3-5 days
- Day 1: Refactor BillDetailScreen with Status Manager
- Day 2: Add settlement progress indicators
- Day 3: Implement remainder calculations display
- Day 4: Bulk updates and visual polish
- Day 5: Testing and validation

**Week 8 Completion**: 5-7 days
- Days 1-2: UPI link generation UI
- Days 3-4: QR code generation and display
- Days 5-6: Share functionality (WhatsApp, SMS)
- Day 7: Testing and validation
