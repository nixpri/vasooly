## Next Steps - Phase 2: Integration & Polish

### Week 7: Payment Status UI 🔜 **NEXT PRIORITY**

**Goal**: Integrate Status Manager into existing UI components

**Tasks**:
1. **Refactor BillDetailScreen** to use Status Manager functions
   - Replace manual `calculateProgress()` with `computeSettlementSummary()`
   - Replace manual `getPaymentSummary()` with `computeSettlementSummary()`
   - Replace manual status updates with `updatePaymentStatus()`

2. **Add Settlement Progress Indicators**
   - Visual progress bar using `paidPercentage` from settlement summary
   - Display paid/pending counts and amounts
   - Show settlement status (ACTIVE/SETTLED)

3. **Remainder Calculation Display**
   - Show remaining amount for partial payments
   - List pending participants with amounts
   - Visual indicators for participants who paid vs pending

4. **Bulk Payment Status Updates**
   - "Mark All Paid" button using `updateBillPaymentStatuses()`
   - "Mark All Pending" button for reversal
   - Batch status updates with confirmation

5. **Bill Status Visual Indicators**
   - Badge/tag for ACTIVE bills (payments pending)
   - Badge/tag for SETTLED bills (fully paid)
   - Color-coded status indicators

### Timeline Estimate
**Week 7 Completion**: 3-5 days
- Day 1: Refactor BillDetailScreen with Status Manager
- Day 2: Add settlement progress indicators
- Day 3: Implement remainder calculations display
- Day 4: Bulk updates and visual polish
- Day 5: Testing and validation

### Dependencies & Blockers

**No Current Blockers ✅**

**All Dependencies Available**:
- ✅ Status Manager (8 functions, 100% coverage)
- ✅ UPI Generator (7 functions, 100% coverage)
- ✅ Split Engine (98.52% coverage)
- ✅ Bill Repository (CRUD operations, 100% coverage)
- ✅ Database Layer (SQLite + SQLCipher, working)
- ✅ UI Components (4 components, glass-morphism design)
- ✅ Type System (Bill, Participant, enums)

### External Dependencies Status

**React Native Packages**:
- ✅ Expo SDK 54 (compatible)
- ✅ React Native 0.76.1 (compatible)
- ✅ FlashList 2.0.2 (compatible)
- ✅ Moti (animations working)
- ✅ Reanimated 4.x (working with entry point import)

**No Outstanding Issues**: All 17/17 expo-doctor checks passing

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Status Manager integration (pure functions, no side effects)
- UPI link generation (already tested, 100% coverage)
- Settlement indicators (read-only display from Status Manager)

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- QR code generation (requires react-native-qrcode-svg testing)
- Contact integration (permissions, privacy concerns)
- Push notifications (infrastructure setup needed)

### High Risk 🚨
- None currently identified

---

**Status**: Phase 1 Complete ✅ | Week 6 Complete ✅
**Next Action**: Plan and implement Week 7 (Payment Status UI)
**Confidence**: High (all dependencies ready, no blockers)
