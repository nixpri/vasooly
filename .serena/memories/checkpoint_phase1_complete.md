## Next Steps

### Week 7: Payment Status UI (Next Priority)
**Goal**: Integrate Status Manager into existing UI

**Tasks**:
1. Refactor BillDetailScreen to use Status Manager functions
2. Add settlement progress indicators using `computeSettlementSummary()`
3. Display remainder calculations for partial payments
4. Implement bulk payment status updates
5. Add bill status visual indicators (ACTIVE/SETTLED)

**Timeline**: 3-5 days estimated

**Dependencies**: All ready ✅
- Status Manager (8 functions, 100% coverage)
- UPI Generator (7 functions, 100% coverage)
- Split Engine (98.52% coverage)
- Bill Repository (CRUD operations)
- Database Layer (SQLite + SQLCipher)
- UI Components (4 components, glass-morphism)

## Technical Context

### Current Implementation State

- Consistent spacing (20px padding)
- Typography hierarchy
- Reanimated 4.x integration points

## Session Learnings

### Documentation Patterns
1. **Week completion status** should be marked at multiple levels:
   - Individual week section (✅ COMPLETE)
   - Phase success criteria
   - Project overview memories
   - Status tracking documents

2. **Phase completion** requires comprehensive updates:
   - Implementation plan with detailed task checklists
   - Project status with progress metrics
   - Serena memories for cross-session continuity
   - Git commit with thorough documentation

3. **Ahead-of-schedule work** should be documented clearly:
   - Note which week the work was actually done
   - Explain why it was completed early
   - Mark as complete in both original and planned weeks

### Git Workflow
1. Stage related documentation files together
2. Write comprehensive commit messages with:
   - Clear summary line
   - Bulleted list of changes
   - Context about what was completed
   - Metrics and achievements
   - Status indicators (✅)
   - Co-authored attribution

### Memory Management
1. Keep memories focused and concise
2. Update multiple memories consistently
3. Include current metrics and progress
4. Document next priorities clearly
5. Maintain cross-references between memories

## Quality Checks

### Documentation Consistency ✅
- All documents show Phase 1 COMPLETE
- Week 6 marked as complete in all locations
- Progress metrics consistent (33.3%, 6/18 weeks)
- Next steps aligned (Week 7: Payment Status UI)

### Git Status ✅
- Clean working tree
- All changes committed
- Commit message comprehensive
- Attribution included

### Memory Status ✅
- phase_status_and_priorities updated
- project_overview updated
- checkpoint created (this file)
- Cross-session continuity maintained

## Recovery Information

### To Resume Work
1. Read memories: `phase_status_and_priorities`, `project_overview`
2. Check git log for recent commits
3. Review IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Week 7 section
4. Begin with Week 7 tasks (Payment Status UI integration)

### Key Files for Week 7
**To Modify**:
- `src/screens/BillDetailScreen.tsx` - Integrate Status Manager
- `src/screens/BillHistoryScreen.tsx` - Add settlement badges
- `src/components/` - May need new progress indicators

**Reference**:
- `src/lib/business/statusManager.ts` - Functions to integrate
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Week 7 task list

### Context for Next Session
- Phase 1 is complete, all core development done
- Week 6 (Basic UI) was completed during Weeks 3-4
- Week 7 is next: integrate Status Manager into UI
- All dependencies ready, no blockers
- Estimated 3-5 days for Week 7 completion
